# AngStore

This project is under development. I started it to study the Angular framework. The objective is to create a simple E-Commerce using Angular on the frontend, Java Spring on the backend, Postgresql as the database and Stripe for payments.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
